# library-backend-java
Both Library MEEN/MEAN apps (version controlled as library-meen-app/library-mean-app) rely on a JavaScript/Node.JS backend implementation. The purpose of this project is to take that backend and implement it in Java/Spring/PostgreSQL. The frontend Ember app should work seamlessly upon completion of this project.
